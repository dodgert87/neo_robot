Explanation of Communication
Local Browser:

The user accesses http://localhost/ in the browser.
The request is sent to the Nginx container.
Nginx Container:

Nginx listens on port 80 and acts as a reverse proxy.
Requests to / are proxied to the Frontend container at http://frontend:8080.
Requests to /api/ are proxied to the Backend container at http://backend:8000.
Frontend Container:

Serves static files (e.g., index.html, CSS, JavaScript) on port 8080.
These files are returned to the browser via Nginx.
Backend Container:

Handles API requests (e.g., /api/chat/) on port 8000.
Processes the requests and sends responses back to Nginx, which forwards them to the browser.
Key Points
Nginx acts as the central entry point for all requests.
Frontend serves static files, while Backend handles API requests.
All containers communicate internally using Docker's network, with service names (frontend and backend) as hostnames.
